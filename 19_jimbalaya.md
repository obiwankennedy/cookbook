## Cuisiner

* In a large heavy pan with a lid, add two tablespoons of olive oil. Add in the celery, bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, and garlic. Saute the veggies over medium-high heat until they begin to get tender. On my gas stovetop this takes about four minutes.
* Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Add another two tablespoons of olive oil to the pan with the veggies. Fold in the chicken and Eckrich Smoked Sausage. Continue to saute everything until the chicken is almost cooked and no longer pink.
* Add in the chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, rice, and homemade Cajun seasoning blend. Mix with a wooden spoon to combine all ingredients. Add two bay leaves. Cover the pan with a lid and lower the heat to medium-low. Allow the jambalaya to simmer until the rice is fully cooked and tender. On my stovetop this takes 25 minutes. While the jambalaya is simmering, stir the ingredients every 4-5 minutes to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning.
* Fold in the shrimp and okra. Cover the pan again and allow the shrimp to cook until done. Once done, remove the two bay leaves from the pot. Do a taste test and see if you need to add in some additional salt and pepper or slightly increase the heat with a sprinkling of more cayenne pepper.
* Your delicious jambala is ready to be garnished with green onions and fresh parsley leaves. Serve and enjoy!
